# Global_Trend-API-Integration

here are the steps to run and understand what all things i have implemented

1. this mini project is as follows :-

contains an index file by which you can interact with the rest api that i have made

contains 2 buttons that triggers 1) -> random data which fetches from 2 distinct api
one is github public api and aothe one is jsonplaceholder

a button that takes 2 things as an input id to filter the jsonplaceholder response and name to filter gthub response

eg feilds that you can try

# KEEP ID =1

# KEEP name = mojombo || defunkt any of these because as you can see when you get random data these names only from github respose

and last requirement was to either store these in a file or database
i have implemented button that just stores the random data in a file

for your references i have attached some screenshots in the screenshot folder
