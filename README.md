# Global_Trend-API-Integration

how to start the server
just you have to
npm i
start the server with the basic command -> node index.js
and click the go live to start the html server in vs code

here are the steps to run and understand what all things i have implemented

1. this mini project is as follows :-

contains an index file by which you can interact with the rest api that i have made

contains 2 buttons that triggers 1) -> random data which fetches from 2 distinct api
one is github public api and aothe one is jsonplaceholder

a button that takes 2 things as an input id to filter the jsonplaceholder response and name to filter gthub response

eg feilds that you can try

# KEEP ID =1

# KEEP name = mojombo || defunkt any of these because as you can see when you get random data these names only from github respose

and last requirement was to either store these in a file or database
i have implemented button that just stores the random data in a file

for your references i have attached some screenshots in the screenshot folder

# IMP THE ONLY HELP I TOOK OF INTERNET AND USED AI WAS TO SOLVE A PROBLEM AFTER IMPLEMENTING THE FILE HANDELING THE SERVER WAS RELOADING AFTER THE DATA WAS SAVED AFTER WHEN I CLICKED THE FILTER DATA BUTTON OR SHOW ALL DATA

# SO IT TOLD ME TO WRITE THE SETTINGS . JSON THAT TOLD THE SERVER NOT TO RELOAD
